## üß∞ Tools and Frameworks Used

- **Cypress**: for end-to-end browser automation and assertions
- **JavaScript**: test scripting
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: to organize page-level logic and selectors
- **Git + GitHub**: for version control

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations / Notes

- **Confirmation dialogs** (e.g., `window.confirm`) are stubbed automatically by Cypress.
- Tests currently run with default browser chrome 
- Form validation edge cases (e.g., invalid characters) are not covered, the form already validate the string inputs
